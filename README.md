This project was developed as part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS PVT. LTD., under the Software Development Internship Program (June-July 2025 Batch).

The primary goal of this task was to build a RESTful API that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books. The API is built using Node.js and Express.js, and data is stored persistently using a local JSON file (books.json), simulating a basic database.

This project demonstrates my understanding of backend API development, REST principles, routing, data handling in JSON format, and API testing using Postman.

‚úÖ Project Objectives:
Understand the fundamentals of REST API architecture.

Implement all four major CRUD operations:

Create (POST) ‚Äì Add new book records.

Read (GET) ‚Äì Fetch all books or a single book by ID.

Update (PUT) ‚Äì Modify details of an existing book.

Delete (DELETE) ‚Äì Remove a book from the collection.

Learn and apply Express.js routing, middleware handling, and JSON data management.

Persist data locally using a JSON file.

Test each API endpoint thoroughly using Postman and capture results.

‚úÖ Project Features:
üìó Add New Book (POST /books):
Allows the user to add a new book by sending JSON data including title, author, ISBN, and published year.

üìò Fetch All Books (GET /books):
Returns a list of all books currently stored in the books.json file.

üìô Fetch a Single Book by ID (GET /books/:id):
Returns detailed information of a single book based on its ID.

üìï Update Book Details (PUT /books/:id):
Enables updating one or more fields (title, author, ISBN, published year) of an existing book.

üóëÔ∏è Delete a Book (DELETE /books/:id):
Removes a specific book from the collection based on its ID.

‚úÖ Success and Error Messages:
Each API response includes clear messages like:

"Book added successfully"

"Books fetched successfully"

"Book updated successfully"

"Book deleted successfully"

Or appropriate error messages if the ID does not exist.

‚úÖ Technologies Used:
Node.js ‚Äì Backend runtime environment.

Express.js ‚Äì Framework for API routing and server handling.

File System Module (fs) ‚Äì For reading/writing to books.json.

Postman ‚Äì For testing and verifying API endpoints.

JSON ‚Äì For data storage and transfer.

‚úÖ API Testing (Proof of Work):
I thoroughly tested all endpoints (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) using Postman.
Screenshots of each step have been attached inside the project repository.
Additionally, I recorded a screen video demonstrating full CRUD operations for my LinkedIn post and personal documentation.

‚úÖ Learning Outcomes:
Gained strong practical understanding of REST API design patterns.

Learned how to build a modular Express app with routes.

Understood how to read and write JSON files using Node.js.

Improved API testing skills using Postman.

Learned how to handle different HTTP methods and status codes properly.

‚úÖ Conclusion:
This project enhanced my skills in backend development, REST architecture, and API testing tools. It also prepared me for real-world scenarios where backend systems interact with frontend or client apps.

Successfully completing this task marks an important milestone in my internship journey and strengthens my overall web development learning experience.
